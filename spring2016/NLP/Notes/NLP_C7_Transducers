Assignment 1 is due today.
Assignment 2 is die 18th March.

Computational Morphology

Lexicon
The list of morphemes together with basic information.
main categories / sub categories etc

Morphotactics
The additional morphem,e irdering that explains which classes of morphesmes can follwo other classe of morphemes.
For example in Englush S mostly makes things plural.

FSA (Finite Stae Automata)
-Accept strings that are in the language
-Reject strings that are not 
-And do it in a way that doesnt require an exhaustive list


FSM (finite state machine)
We want to model
X+PL (word + plural)

Multi-tape finite state machines

Cat - intermediate - cats
fox - intermediate - foxes

Intermediate step is where you decide es vs s

FSA = This only matches
FSM = has input and output

Parsing/Generation vs Recognition

You can inver the FSM. 


Finite State Transducers (FST)

Instead of the letter mapping to themselves the latters map to something else.

Build a machine that when you see 
C->C / A->A / T->T / +N+PL -> s
cat+N+PL -> cats
(this can go either way)

We usually apply this in two steps. Start to intermediate. Intermediate to final.
Make sure that everything default passes through.

Ambiguity 
Problem with parsing is that sometimes you dont know what the word is without context. (verb or noun etc?)

So one option is to check context.
One is to cascade and  give everything.

Shibboleth - identifier.

Multi Tape Machine (MTM)
# means end of word

epsilon' -> e / {x,s,z} ^ __ s#
it means do the transformation / {start} transformation here endoftheword#
