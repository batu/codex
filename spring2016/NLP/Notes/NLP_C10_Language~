Models of Evaluation

Extrinsic vs Intrinsic evaluations

Extrinsic: How is it evaluated in the context. Application.
Intrinsic: Inherent metric.

Helicopter evaluation model.  Translate the manual and get them to land the helicopter with the new thing.

Intuition of Perplexity

The Shannon Game:
How well can we predcit the next world.

Unigrams are terrible. (1 word)
because there is no context

Perplexity
The best language model is one that best predicts an unseen test set
Gives the highest P(sentence)

Inverse of the probability normalized for the number of words.

The test set has to be the same.

Minimizin perplexity is the same as maximizing probability.

Average weighted branching factor

Where can I go? Lower perplexity the better model! 

Instead of sending you to 30000 random places on expeted you have 53 outcomes.
