semantics - meaning (what kind)
Pragmatics - Context aware, this that he and she

Worse than ambiguity is OOV (out of vocabulary)

Ambiguity:
I made her duck - What do they mean

Lexical catagory - Duck can be a noun or a verb (of her)
Lexical category - her can be possessive or dative ( for her)

Non Transitive  non direct object - i slept
Transitive takes a direct object - I cooked duck
Ditransitive takes two 2 direct objects - I made her into a duck
ACtion transitive takes a direct object and another verb I caused her to move her body

Phonetics

I mate or duck
I maid her duck

Probalistic differentiation
Markov models and (what word does follow the other one )
Gramatically sound



I saw the man with a telescope ( pervasive)

Disambiguation is in context

1) Knowledge from other levels can help devide at ambiguous levels
2) Pipeline processing that ignores ambiguity as it occurs and hopes that other levels can eliminate incorrect structures
3) Probabilistic approaches based on making the most likely choice
4) Don't do anything, it might not matter.
