Minimum edit distance

The distance between to strings
Find the distance between two strings. Modifications
Deletions, substution, insertion, (Sub is weighted differently sometimes)
* is epsilon
the cost is a parameter you can decide.
Mostly - one for each 

Usefull for different applications. Generating a particular sequence
Searching for a path (sequence of edits) because you know where you want to go restrict the space
dynamic programming

You define the problem in a recursive way. Solve the problem of the substring. 

D(i, 0) = i; as you can delete i from i to get 0 or add j to 0 to get j
D(0, j) = j

The algorithm

D(i - 1, j    ) + 1
D(i    , j - 1) + 1
D(i - 1, j - 1) + { 2; if X(i) != Y(j)
		  { 0; if X(i)  = Y(j)



o(nm) time 
o(nm) space

Not all edits are equal

Keyboard arrangement also is important
or mouth shape



You know all the possibilites
Good Turing Discounting
Moving the sums around
The fact that one appeared is not that far from those that didnt appear.

Looking at the 


c* = (c+1)Nc+1/Nc

Nc = number of words that appear c times

Nc + 1/Nc we expect to be smaller


Take shakespear corpus and multiply it 10 times to make it bigger to fit a bigger corpus

I saw the man with a telescope
think about moving it around 

a man with a telescope has seen by me
With a telescop I saw a man

Form: How do you put things together
Funciton: Meaning

Write +er -e : This is form. How do you put together. No meaning information.
if you add this morpheme to that morpheme you do stuff (er changes verb to a noun)


Morpheme - smallest word that has a meaning to it.

Affixes - prefix Stem Suffix
Infix - in the middle
Circumfix - A-X-A

Reduplication
bili - bibili

Ablaut and suppletion
fall - fell
Think - thought
go - went

Allomophy
more than one expression of one morpheme
cats, dogs, foxes /s/ /z/ /iz/

Clitics
syntanticly independant and phonologically dependant
