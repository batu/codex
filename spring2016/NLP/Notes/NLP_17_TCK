Tree banks
Inter annatotar Agreement (IAA)
Get two people working on the same dataset. Divide the work %60 %60
And also a third piece on a "Lead Judge"

Treebanks implicityly define a grammer for the language.
Take the local rules and combine them tadaa you have grammer.
Take all the structures that Happened!

Dependency trees includes heads: the one with head first
Free structure/ Contigency : the tree one.


Syntaxtix analysis.

Colorless green ideas sleep furiously. (Syntacticly solid, meaning wise very unreasonable)


I ate the spaghetti with chopsticks
I ate the (spagethhi with meatballs)

The parsers are different in these case. 
In the second case you shouldnt divide spahethi with meatballs

Spagethi with meatballs was eaten by X
Spagethi was eaten by X with chopstics  - different!

Top down parsing: Take a look at the S structures, just try to fir the words into your tags. Going iver all the allowed rules.

Bottom up parsing: start with words and attach tags. Check on the local level if it works. You can have trees that are not plausable.

TD: Never explores options that will not lead to  a full parse, but can explore 

You always start with an S


CNF (a more restrictive form)
Non terminal goes to 2 things, or they go to the terminal.

The algorithms dont exactly have to use teh same grammer. Intermediate steps don thave to be identical.
