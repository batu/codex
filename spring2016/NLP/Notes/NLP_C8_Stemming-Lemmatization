Stemming and Lemmatization.

Stemming
-Reduce morphological variation in a text by mapping the words to their common stem. 

Tend to be a shallow alogrithm using cascade rewrite rules.
-Score, scored, scores, scoring -> scor
-be, is, was, were, am, being, been -> be,i,wa,wer,am*
-play,playful -> play

Lemmatization
-Reduce morphological variation in a text by mapping the words to their lemma (aka dictinioary form (mastar))

Tend to be more complex than stemming.
-Score, scored, scores, scoring -> score
-be, is, was, were, am, being, been -> be
-play,playful -> play, playful(playNoun + fulAD)

The Porter Stemmer(Porter, 1980)

C?(VC)^mV?
C = string of one or more consonants
V = string of one or more vowels
m = the measure of the string

Tree = 0
Troubled = 2

Check the rules.
