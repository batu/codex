Finite State Automata

We can use this to define regexes.
Generative grammer is used in linguestic to mean a grammer of formal language.


Regular expressions - regular languages - finite automata 
They are all rekated to each other, They can be expressed in other terms.

Two circles means accepting state. 

FSA Finite State Automata
Represents the reuglar language. Does it match or not match.

Finitte state Transducers
These do a transduction. Mapping

With an epsilon type you can change the state without consuming the type

PAge 17. How do you represent when you can use the Epsilon?

For every NFSA there exists and eqivalent DFSA (map non deterministic to deterministic)It adds a layer of abstraction

An example of this, the mapping. How do you escape the infitine state?

Implementation of Union
make the accepting state the initial state of another one.
