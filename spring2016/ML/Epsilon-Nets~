Combinatoial Setting

P = Set of dots
We get a subset defined by a rectangular are.

If there are 
What is the upper bound.

Shrink the box until it touches the dots.

N choose 4 + n choose 3 + n choose 2 + n choose 1
O(n^4)


Learning is possible because it is not exponential, 

How many rectangles. 
Efficiently learnable objects. If you are in polynomial.

Epsilon Net Problem.

VC  - Size of the largest set that can be shattered. Only one is enough not all.
