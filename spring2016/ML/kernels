Keep the functions linear because of computational


Feature map
Map the space of points to a higher dimention.

Featuremap one of the three ways of getting into them.
PD = positive definite kernel
RKHS = reproducsing kernel hikbert space

Kernel is a similarity measure.
dot product is what we use.

define the same operations (dot product) in functions.

We dont want negative similarity. so we need positive definitiveness. 

We need the K matrix to be symetric as otherview K(xi,xj) != K(kj,ki)

Hilbert Space (HS): Is a complete possibly infinite dimensional linear space with an innter product.
Every sequence converges to a point with in the definiton. 

kernels are basically functions and they take two inputs. One fixes it the other one defines a point otn it.

Def an evaluational functional over the HS of function of ElementH isa  linear function.

We are doing this to work with infinite input spaces.

The norm of the function.

some point in H that depends on T.
