Version Control

Distributed vs Centralized


Centralized
	SVN
	CVS
	RCS

local - central

when you commit you are actually pushing it back to the central server.
If you happen to lose your server, tough luck.

Distributed
	git
	
When you check out you get ALL the changes that has been done up to that point.

local - stage - github

Git uses hash files to compare.
