John wants to go into a new 1v1 one competitive games as he is bored of playing games in which he relies on his teammates. He also complains about the stale meta and th slow update rate of the other games he has played. So he opens up this game and merly plays said game.

Designer:
I should be able to look at the algorithm and the see variable that change. Graph them and visually see. Have a non technical interface to tweak the algortithm.

Developer:
Should be able to keep on implementing new characters/ maps and etc, The workflow should be flexible to incorperate the new steps.
