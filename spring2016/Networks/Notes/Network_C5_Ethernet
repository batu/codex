Ethernet

Broadcast system, everything goes to everyone.


4 repeaters 5 hosts a total of 2500.

Default you send it to the MAC adress of the router and the router only reads that message. This is set in the header.
Broadcast is sent to everyone.
Multicast you send it to a group.
Promiscous mode.

Furthest apart 2 nodes are 500m. 


Ethernet Transmission Algorithm.
	t = transmision start
	d = link latency
	First bit of frame A arrive to B = t + d
	Before t+d B starts its own transmission
	The frames will collide and it will be detected by B
	Host B will send a 32-bit jammin signal
	Host A will not know that the collision occured until Bs frame reaches it, it will be at t + 2d


Example:
	Roundtrip time 51.2 ms (2d)
	which on 10Mbps to 512 bit
	If the frame is smaller than 512 then the transmission will end early and it will not receive the collision and jamming signal

!!!When a collision is detected
Each time you transmit and fail it doubles the amount you wait. 
Exponential Backoff
The adaptor first delay is 0 or k * 51.2 ms selected at random and at the begining k is = 1
If it collides k increses by the virtue of k = 2^n - 1 and a random k between 0 and k is selected and it waits 0 or k * 51.2ms
k = 2^n - 1

51.2 = this is the RTT. Waiting for this makes sure you skip one cycle.

Ethernet works best under light loads (due to reasons above)
Max hosts is 1024 but mostly they have 200 hosts.

Most ethernetes are shorter than 2500m with the roundtrip delay going down to 5ms.

They are easy to maintain and inexpensive. You broadcast to everyone so everyone will get it eventually.
