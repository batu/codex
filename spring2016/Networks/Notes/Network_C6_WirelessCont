Hidden Node Problem:
A-B-C 
C doesnt see A. So A and C can collide.

Exposed Node Problem:
A-B-C-D
B sending to A blocks C from moving in reality it can send to D.

Solution:
RTS (ready to send)
CTS (clear to send)

Using these two signals nodes handle these.

802.11 has no collission detection, this RTF-CTS is used avoid collisions.

Some nodes are connected to each other with wires.
Access Point (AP) 

Even if you dont have direct communication between nodes your data can travel through other hosts.

How to select the Access point - Scanning

Node sends a Probe frame.
All APs reply with Probe Response
Usually you chose the highest signal to interference ratio.
You send a request for Association Request frame.
AP replies with an association Response frame.

This happens when the node first connects to the network.
Or moves so another AP has a better Signal to Interference ratio.

Active: Node periodically scans.
Passive: The APs push a header telling the S/I ratio
This doesnt change the IP address so you dont lose your YouTube video.

(Certain standarts you use multiple nodes 4G+)

Frame Format:
Source and Destinations Addresses: each 48bit
Data: up to 2312 bytes
CRC: 32 bit
Control Field: 16 bit
	This has 6 bit Type
	1 bit distributed
	ToDS
	FromDS

4 Address:

In 1 on 1 it is fine. Add 1 is source, Add 2 is destionation.
But in distributed systems:
Add1 Ultimate destionation
Add2 Immediate Sender
Add3 Immediate Destination
Add4 Originial Source
