Uses License Exempt Frequency:
Commercial Use - Shared Frequencies. Wifi-Bluetooth
Protected Frequencies: AM/FM/3G etc... Police/Military

Used for very short range.
Up to 10m
2.45GHz
Power consumption is very low.

Bluetooth is specified by and industry Bluetooth Special Interest Group.

Bluetooth has profiles.
Bluetooth network configuration is called a piconet.

You can have 7 slave for 1 master. 
You can have 255 parked which are dormant and the master can wake em up.
None of the slaves can transmit without the masters permission.

Spread Specturum (Widen it up to reduce noise) and Frequency Hopping(Divides the stuff and distributes it ot frequence)


ZigBee - IEEE 802.15.4 - Competition to Bluetooth
For situations:
1)Bandwith requirement is low
2) Power consumption ver low
3) Long battery life
Basically weaving a net. So they should self organize.

Encoding:
	Switching Data to transmitable to 0 and 1
Framing:
	The frame structure. The length, header when does it end when does it start. Control field data field etc. Bits - Bytes
Error Detecting:
	Detect maybe fix them. 
		a) Error that result in corruption in the package. Identify it (if you need, correct it but this is extremely expensive)
Reliability:
	Yeah.. Dont let it crash.
Multiple Access Link:
	You are sharing the space with others. So you need a protocol of sharing. Ethernet / 802.11

In ethernet 30% utilization is really high (due to collissions etc)
