Databases Class 3: Normalization 



 
     - R1 (XUY)
R  -
     - R2 R - (XUY)

There are normal forms.
	1NF
	2NF
	3NF
	BCNF

Can  I always guarentee BCNF?
	NO.

Example:
	Client has one account IN a firm. Client can have different firms.
	Client, Firm -> Account

	An account can have many clients but it exists in one firm.
	Account -> Firm

3NF allows redundancy to preserve FDs!

Some people will say BCNF is too much.
