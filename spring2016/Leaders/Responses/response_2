Third paragraph: Why this situation involves leadership 
Fourth paragraph: what do we learn from reading this report.

"We are all born into action, ..." said Charles Horton Cooley in 1902. I believe he was right. In each and everyone of us the desire to act exists. And this desire alone establishes the foundation for the creation of great leaders. However just like this quote, the inherent desire to act is only half of the bigger picture. When we look at the full quote we see that Charles Horton Hooley continues his sentence with these words: ... and whatever is capable of suggesting and guiding action has power over us from the first." He himself shines light on the importance of guiding ang leading action. As this quote implies, I argue that leadership is not only acting, but in addition to that, it is leading and guiding other peoples actions. In this paper I will more clearly look at both halves of leadership: Action and Guiding and try to give a definiton of leadership.

I believe we can breakdown leadership into two main components. Action and guidance. Lets start by discussing action as it creates the baseline for this concept. There can not be leadership without action but not every action results in leadership. To be a leader one must know know when to act and seize the moment. However taking action is not necesary, by the virtue of taking action the leader must also unvoke action among others. Going back to the quote of Charles Horton Cooley, every person has the dormant power tp act and a leaders job os to tap into this power and use it as a resource, However this is not enough, just tapping into this power and creating an angry mob is not leadership. This is similar to opening the floodgates of a dam. It is true that the roaring water has unimaginable power to destroy everything in its path but without any guidance it is useless. It will not diffrenciate friend or foe and instead be no different than a raging flood. We can see similar examples of this in history. For the purposes of this response paper we will be focusing on the Turkish histroy but there are many other examples throughout the world such as the 8888 Burma uprising of 1988 where over 3000 people were killed an nothing of value was changed or the Bloody Week of the 1871 in France where 20000 people died because the a socialist group claimed governence of Paris. Instead we will be looking at a more recent example, the Gezi Parki Protests of 2013. 


but that doesnt make us leaders,
leaders also have to guide it.

Gezi Parki, action
