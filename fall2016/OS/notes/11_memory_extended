can you swap out?
    1) User level
        yes
    2) Kernel code
        Mostly yes, you will get shat on in your performance
        You CANNOT swap out code that handles swapping
    3) Page tables
        Yes but it is very dangerous


The for loop trick

Hardware Optimizations to Paging

    Learn about virtual memory

TLB - Fully Associative Cache
        Just the translation of your address
    It is designed that when you get a memory you check things in paralel
    Small: 16-64
        Constrained by money and the level of specialization
    up to 99% hit ratio
        Because of locality

    all you need is virtual to physcial mapping

    Valid bit != present bit
    on a context switch you you make everything invalid.
        If you dont have a process tag (hardware dependent) TLB gets flushed on every context switch
    

    ask about inverted page tables: 
        These have one limitation
            no matter what I need to map virtual to physcial. What if they are not mapped anywhere in memory.
            An addditional mapping exists
            You cant share pages between processes 
                zero page
                resource sharing etc   
        

    Zeroing pages:
        Security reasons
        Reading memory dumps

    Kernel has to be careful about internel fragmentation
        Dude to constrained memory

    kernel memory managemnet is different   
        hardware has buffers that they write to 
        there is a pool of data structures
            trees nodes etc
