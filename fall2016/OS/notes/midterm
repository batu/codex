Overview

    OS includes kernel, boot loader device drivers command shell basic file and system util

    Kernel
        Interrupt handling
        Process scheduling
        memeory management to manage process address space
        interprocess communication
        system services such as file system and nterworking

    User process run in user space vs kernel space under kernel mode privilages

    1) What are the purpose of rings. How many rings modes does linux support?
        protection levels. Ring 0 highest access
            usually CPU and Memoery
        x86 supporrts 0123
    2) In x86, how can the processor tell if an instruction requires privelege?   
        It is set in the code segment register.

    Contexts
There are three possible contexts:
    1) User-Space executing user code
    2) kernel-space in process context
        executing on behalf of specific process
    3) Kernel-space in interrupt context
        not associated with a process but handling an interrupt

    CPP
    Preprocessor
        Gets C code and outputs more C code.
            Bascially parses the Definitions into C and replaces some other shortcuts. This is architecture independent

    Compilers
        These get the preprocessed C code and outputs assembly code
        
    Assembler 
        Takes the assembly code and translates into machine code. The result is architecture specific
