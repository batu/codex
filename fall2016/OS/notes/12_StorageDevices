Operating systems do scale. Assumptions are exaggurated


Cost of 10x slower to write. 

no longer the OS takes care of stuff. Now the harddisks ship with a controller
Controller is like a tiny processor on the storage device.

Disk -> Controller -> Cache -> Interface

There are multople disk interfaces

Disk controllers takes care of blacklisting constantly corrupted places (for example wear and tear)

    It has error correcting code. If few bits get flipped it might fix it.

    It can schedule when to read and write.
    They interleave write read because if you consequtively read you can fill up the buffer.


How to read or write from a sector?
    C-H-S (mostly obsolete) LBA (logical block addressing) allows it to be multiplatfor
    The arm seeks to the right cylinder
    Waits until the sector comes below the head, reads from/ writes to

Disk Formatting:
    Wipes out your disk.
    Re creates Preambles/Headers


Disks also come with spare sectors that are used when things get corrupted. 


7200 full rotation is 8ms
expected rotation is 4ms

the seek cost is about 4-10ms

40-125MB/s transfer bandwith

Seek + Rotational Delay + Transfer

4ms + 4ms + 1kb/125mbs/s 

our effective transfer rate is 1kb/8.007ms = 125KB/s = 1/1000th
