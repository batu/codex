Concurrency Controll

	Why do interrupt handlers only form the toop half of the interrupt processing?

	The top half just notifies the interrupt.

1) Interrupts are async: they fuck up potentially important code.
2) You lock other interrupts. Which you dont want to do a lot.
3) It is time critical as they deal with hardware, what if you are dealing with nukes?
4) Something else, check the slide.

Butting something to the bottom half means "Do it eventually"

Rules for Top Half / Bottom Half.
	1) Time sensitivie = top half.
	2) Shouldnt be interrupted = top half
	3) Hardware (slow) = bottom half
	4) Everything else = bottom half

Why not do all top half?
	For example you need to load packet to memory. But memory hasnt been loaded! So you hang the whole system because you are in tio half. So yeah...


It really doesnt hurt interactivity anyhow...
