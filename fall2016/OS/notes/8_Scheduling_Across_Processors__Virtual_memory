Sometimes the scheduler can become the bottleneck.
1) Centralized scheduling
    A dedicated master scheduler processor
2) Distributed Scheduling
    Every processor will have its own scheduler thread with its own queues.
    Load Balancing
        Job Pushing
        Work Stealing
    Sometimes certain caches are set up for tasks so you want the certain processor to do the job
    
    Multiple Queue
        You can controll process affinity better
    Single Queue
        Less variance
        But you are also sharing this data structure
