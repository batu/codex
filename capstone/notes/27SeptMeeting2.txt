Custom Game vs Self Built Game

Focused on single player game in Unity.
	Allows us to extract a better metrics.
	In PVP zero sum kind of game which allows us to look at win percentages which means in our small sample case would be problematic.
	In singleplayer we can use "time spent alive" which can result in much better showing of our tuning.


Current Metric is Time.


Tournament and Live Tuning
	

Tournament Problems:
	1) Matchmaking
		- People with different skills
	

Experiment Procedure
	Allow players to play with each character as test drive.
	Ask players to play each character 5 times. 
	

Idea 1:
	Objective:
		Test responses to tuning
		How do people respond to nerfing / buffing to chars
		Test the quality of the algorithm.
	Method:
		Things are out of tune to begin with. 
		Play 3 games with each.
		Survey	
		Tune
		Another three games with each.
		Survey.

Idea 2:
	Objective:
		Test autotuning over time.
	Problems:
		We need lots of data.
		People would need to play concurrently and recurringly.
	Method:
		Set a leader board as means to get long running play sessions.
			Can assume player be not the same.
			Players can sign up for the calendar. And tune it over a timeline. 
				Players are staggered so there is equal amount of time between players. 
			Surveys after every sessions.
				How did it feel.
				Check the metrics.
	

Idea 3:
	Obejctive
		Analyse existing patch notes.
		See how literature does it, (for objective)

We want to test:
 	Fairness
		perceived or numerical
 	Oscillation
		As our algo works do things go up and down?
	Sandbag / Cheat
		People lose with it so they can play with it next week.
